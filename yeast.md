### Key take aways

Pitch 2 packets for 20L. Always.
If you underpitch you produce more esters.

### Rehydration

- Do not use distilled water when rehydrating yeast
- Do not use undiluted wort
- Use tap water
- Do not stir after adding dry yeast

Afteer ateperation innoculate without delay
Pitching rate: 0.5-1g/L
Aeration of wort is not necessary

### Bottle conditioning

Pitch rate is 10% of what is recommended for fermenting wort
"Best practices for bottle conditioning" is available on Lallemand

### Esters

Glucose => pyruvate => CO2 + Ethanol
Pyruvate are Esters
More glucose = more esters
Shape of the fermenter actually make a difference
High levels of esters: open > horizontal > vertical > cylindroconical

For more Esters
- low pitch rate
- higher temperature
- higher gravity

### Biotransformation

Higher level of bioglucosamyte enhance hops transformation and releases aromas
New England, Abbaye & NEIPA are good for that

### Sour fermentation

Brett & Lactic Acid producing bacteria (lactobaccilus)

Lacto
Fermets glucose, fructose and sucrose, but not maltotriose

Mash souring, kettle souring, co-fermentation, spontaneous ageing

Protocl : recomended kettle sour precedure
"Sour Pitch" is available
