# Water

Top 5 for good beer. In order

1. Sanitize
2. Control ferm temp
3. plenty of clean yeast
4. control the boil
5. a good recipe
6. water adjustment.

The mineral profile in the brewing water is the seasoning in beer.
PH first, seasoning second.

Calcium

Magnesium

Sulfate
High sulfate for bitter IPAs to avoid having a lingering bitterness taste.
Low suflate in IPAs tends to add a lingering bitterness.

Chloride
Enhance  malt characters.

Sodium
imrpoves mouthfeel sweetness.
Too much tastes metallic.

Suflate to Chloride Ratio
Dryness vs Fullness
9:1 to 0.5:1
Max sulfate is 500 ppm
Max chloride is 200 ppm

Water pH is not important
Water pH is not important
Water pH is not important
Mash pH IS important

Estimate mash ph

Base malt alk x weight +
Speciality malt acidity x weight +
water residual alk. x weight =
Total alk

Beer color (amber, pale, dark) => residual alkalinity (mash ph)
Flavor balance (hoppy, balanced, malty) => Sulfate to Chloride ration
Beer Structure => Calcium level
