# Fermentation

The faster the yeast grow, the more byproducts it produces.
Its byproducts don't have time to be converted as it takes more nutrients/sugar in and simply releases it in the wort.

2 primmary byproducts that can be cleanup up:
- Diacetyl
  - Dry hopping can result in more diacetyl because you're adding oxygen
  - Dry hopping at high krausen can aleviate this issue
- Acetaldehyde
  - Zinc is important cofactor to acetaldehyde reduction

#### Control maturation

Control growth rate (start low temp, finish high temp)
Control amount of growth (pitching rate vs OG)
Control activity (temperature)
  - Raise temperature by 3-5C towards the end of fermentation to keep the yeast active
  - No higher than 24C

#### Pitching rates

Ales: 0.75 billion/liter/degree P
Lages: 1.5 billion/liter/degree P

Go with 1 billion because overpitching doesn't hurt. It will reduce your ester productions though.
